class Stoichiometry(Sequence):
    """
    Immutable container representing one or more chemical stoichiometries.

    This class is used to describe *sets of compositions* for atomistic
    structure generation and high-throughput materials screening workflows.
    Each entry in the container is a dictionary mapping chemical element
    symbols to integer atom counts (e.g. ``{"Fe": 2, "O": 3}``).

    The class supports algebra-like operations that are commonly used in
    compositional design spaces:

    - Addition (``+``): concatenation of stoichiometry lists
    - Inner product (``|``): element-wise combination of compatible stoichiometries
    - Outer product (``*``): Cartesian product of compatible stoichiometries

    These operations are especially useful when constructing multi-element
    composition grids for crystal structure sampling, phase space exploration,
    or workflow graph nodes.

    Attributes:
        stoichiometry (tuple[dict[str, int]]):
            Tuple of stoichiometry dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds
            to one candidate composition.
