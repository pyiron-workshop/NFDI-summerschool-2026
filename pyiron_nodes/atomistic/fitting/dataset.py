    """
    Load a pickled atomistic dataset into a standardized pandas DataFrame.

    This node reads a pickled dataset containing atomistic simulation data
    and normalizes column names and formats to ensure compatibility with
    downstream fitting, prediction, and analysis nodes.

    The function performs several consistency checks and conversions:
    - Ensures ASE ``Atoms`` objects are stored under the ``ase_atoms`` column
    - Normalizes atom-count column naming
    - Ensures a corrected energy column is present
    - Infers periodic boundary conditions if missing

    Args:
        file_path (str):
            Path to the pickled dataset file.
        compression (str, optional):
            Compression type used for the pickle file (e.g. ``"gzip"``).

    Returns:
        pandas.DataFrame:
            Cleaned and standardized dataset ready for atomistic
            machine-learning workflows.
